# b7s daemon

b7s is a peer-to-peer networking daemon for the blockless network. It is supported on Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms for both x64 and arm64 architectures.

## Installation

You can install b7s using either curl or wget:

```bash
# using curl
sudo sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocklessnetwork/b7s/main/download.sh | bash"

# using wget
sudo sh -c "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocklessnetwork/b7s/main/download.sh -v -O download.sh; chmod +x download.sh; ./download.sh; rm -rf download.sh"
```

You can also use Docker to install b7s. See the [Docker documentation](/docker/README.md) for more information.

## Usage

For a more detailed overview of the configuration options, see the [b7s-node Readme](/cmd/node/README.md#usage).
